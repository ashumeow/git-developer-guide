Using GIT Directly
==================

For beginners to Sage development we recommend using the Sage
development scripts as explained in :ref:`chapter-walk-through`, which
simplify using git and the trac server. However, you can use git
directly to work on Sage if you prefer. This chapter will tell you how
to do so assuming some familiarity with git.

.. warning::

    For now, use the ``build_system`` branch instead of master. This
    will be changed soon.
