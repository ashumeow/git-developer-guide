<span id="chapter-trac-old"></span><h1>The Sage Trac Server: Submitting Patches and Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#the-sage-trac-server-submitting-patches-and-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>What should you do with your Mercurial patches for Sage? You should
post them on the Sage trac server.</p>
<p>The Sage trac server, located at
<a class="reference external" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/</a>, is where Sage bugs are listed
and patched, new code is posted and reviewed, and ideas for
extending and improving Sage are discussed. Thus if you find a bug
in Sage, or if you have new code to submit, or if you have
corrections for the documentation, you should post on the trac
server.</p>
<p>Items on the server are called &#8220;tickets&#8221;, and anyone may browse the
tickets: just visit <a class="reference external" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report">http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/report</a>. You
need to open an account, though, if you want to comment on a
ticket, submit a patch, or create a new ticket. See the
<a class="reference external" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac">trac server</a>
for more information about obtaining an account. This chapter contains
various guidelines on using the trac server.</p>
<div class="section" id="reporting-bugs">
<h2>Reporting bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>&#8220;The first step is admitting you have a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you think you have found a bug in Sage, you should first search
through the following Google groups for postings related to your
possible bug:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-devel</span></tt>: <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel">http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel</a></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-support</span></tt>: <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support">http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe the problem you have encountered has already been discussed. You
should also search the trac server to see if anyone else has opened a
ticket about your bug.</p>
<p>If you do not find anything, and you are not sure that you have found
a bug, ask about it on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-devel</span></tt>. You might be asked to open a
new ticket on the trac server. As mentioned above, you need an account
to do this. To report a bug, login and click on the &#8220;New ticket&#8221;
button. Type a meaningful one-liner in the &#8220;Short summary&#8221; box, with
more information in the larger box below. You should include at least
one explicit, reproducible example illustrating your bug (and/or the
steps required to reproduce the buggy behavior). You should also
include the version of Sage (and any relevant packages) you are using,
and operating system information, being precise as possible (32-bit,
64-bit, ...).</p>
<p>Between the &#8220;Summary&#8221; and &#8220;Full description&#8221; boxes, there is a
place to choose the &#8220;Type&#8221; of the ticket: &#8220;Defect&#8221;, &#8220;Enhancement&#8221;,
or &#8220;Task&#8221;. Use your best judgment here; a bug should probably be
reported as a &#8220;Defect&#8221;.</p>
<p>Choose a priority for your bug, keeping in mind that the &#8220;blocker&#8221;
label should be used very sparingly. Also pick a component for your
bug; this is sometimes straightforward. If your bug deals with
Sage&#8217;s calculus implementation, choose &#8220;calculus&#8221;. If it is not
obvious, do your best. Choose a milestone; if you are not sure what
to choose, just choose the numbered version of Sage from the menu
(&#8220;sage-4.3.3&#8221;, for example). Type in some helpful keywords. In the
box labeled &#8220;Assign to&#8221;, type &#8220;somebody&#8221; if you are not sure what
else to do.</p>
<p>Hit the &#8220;Preview&#8221; button to make sure everything looks okay, and
then hit &#8220;Submit ticket&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you do not have an account on the trac system to report directly,
you are still encouraged to report any possible bug to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-devel</span></tt> mailing list at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-devel&#64;googlegroups.com</span></tt>.
The list is moderated for new users and requires subscription.
In your bug report to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-devel</span></tt>, make sure to include the
following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>operating system</strong>: as precise as possible and architecture
(32-bit, 64-bit, ...)</li>
<li>affected version: the exact <strong>version number</strong> and the downloaded
package (source, precompiled, virtual machine image, or an upgrade
from a previous version (which one?))</li>
<li>provide a <strong>reproducible example</strong> and/or define the steps to
reproduce the erroneous behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you in advance for reporting bugs to improve Sage in the future!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guidelines-for-opening-tickets">
<h2>Guidelines for opening tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines-for-opening-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to bug reports, you should also open a ticket if you
have some new code which extends Sage&#8217;s capabilities. If you have a
feature request, start a discussion on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-devel</span></tt> first,
and then if there seems to be general agreement that you have a
good idea, open a ticket describing the idea.</p>
<p>When you consider opening a new ticket, please bear the following
points in mind.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Before opening a ticket, make sure that nobody else has opened a
ticket about the same or closely related issue.</li>
<li>It is much better to open several specific tickets than one that
is very broad. Indeed, a single ticket which deals with lots of
different issues can be quite problematic, and should be avoided.</li>
<li>Be precise: If foo does not work on OS X but is fine on Linux,
mention that in the title. Use the keyword option so that
searches will pick up the issue.</li>
<li>The problem described in the ticket must be solvable. For
example, it would be silly to open a ticket whose purpose was
&#8220;Make Sage the best mathematical software in the world&#8221;. There is
no metric to measure this properly and it is highly subjective.</li>
<li>If appropriate, provide URLs to background information or email
threads relevant to the problem you are reporting.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stopgaps">
<h2>Stopgaps<a class="headerlink" href="#stopgaps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a component of Sage produces a mathematical error, you should open
two tickets: a main ticket with all available details, and also a
&#8220;stopgap&#8221; ticket. This second ticket should have a patch which will be
merged into Sage if no one fixes the main issue; this patch should print a
warning when anyone uses the relevant code. To produce the warning
message, use code like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sage.misc.stopgap</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">stopgap</span>
<span class="n">stopgap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;This code contains bugs and may be mathematically unreliable.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">TICKET_NUM</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Replace <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TICKET_NUM</span></tt> by the ticket number for the main ticket.  See
<a class="reference external" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/12699">trac ticket #12699</a>, for example.  On the main trac ticket, you should also
enter the ticket number for the stopgap ticket in the &#8220;Stopgaps&#8221;
field.  Stopgap tickets should be marked as blockers.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If mathematically valid code causes Sage to raise an error or
crash, for example, there is no need for a stopgap.  Rather,
stopgaps are to warn users that they may be using buggy code; if
Sage crashes, this is not an issue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="patching-bugs-working-on-tickets">
<h2>Patching bugs/working on tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#patching-bugs-working-on-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have code which fixes a bug or deals with some issue in
Sage, here is what to do. First, use Mercurial to create a patch
file. See <a class="reference internal" href="walk_through_old.html#chapter-walk-through-old"><em>Walking Through the Development Process</em></a> for more information on using
Mercurial to produce/manage patches. If the issue has been reported as
a ticket on the trac server, attach your patch file to that ticket: go
to the ticket, click on the &#8220;Attach File&#8221; button, and follow the
directions. On the ticket page, you should add a comment explaining
your patch. Some relevant information include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The version of Sage you used to create the patch. If the patch is
based on Sage x.y.z, ensure you include such information.</li>
<li>If the ticket has more than one patch, explicitly specify which ones
are to be used. Are all of the patches to be applied? Or only a
subset of the patches on the ticket?</li>
<li>If more than one patch is to be applied, state the order in which
those patches are to be applied.</li>
<li>Does the ticket depend on another ticket? Sometimes, a ticket
requires that the patches on another ticket be applied first. Be
sure to include such information if relevant.</li>
<li>It is best to supply information about ticket dependencies and patch
order in a way that the Patch Buildbot can understand. This bot
automatically applies patches from trac and tests them.
See its wiki: <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot">http://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is no trac ticket associated to this issue, create one (as
explained in the previous sections) describing the issue and your
solution, and attach your patch.</p>
<p>The following are some other relevant issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Every bug fixed should result in a doctest.</li>
<li>Cooperative debugging via IRC is faster by at least an order of
magnitude. If you have not learned how to use IRC, please do so.
If you have problems using IRC because of firewalls, but you do
have an account on the machine <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage.math</span></tt>, you can use irssi via
ssh there. If you have a flaky connection, you can use it together
with the program screen.</li>
<li>This is not an issue with defects, but there are many enhancements
possible for Sage and too few developers to implement all the
good ideas. The trac server is useful for keeping ideas
in a central place because in the Google groups they tend to get
lost once they drop off the first page.</li>
<li>If you are a developer, be nice and try to solve a stale/old
ticket every once in a while.</li>
<li>Some people regularly do triage. Triage in this context means
that we look at new bugs and classify them according to our
perceived priority. It is very likely that different people will
see priorities of bugs very differently from us, so please let
us know if you see a problem with specific tickets.</li>
<li><strong>Patches Preferred</strong>: Patches are easier to review, edit and
can be merged without affecting the history. So we greatly prefer
patches over Mercurial bundles. If you do have a large number of
patches, a bundle can still be better than patches. One
alternative to bundles is to use Mercurial queues to flatten the
history. That might or might not be desirable. See
<a class="reference internal" href="walk_through_old.html#chapter-walk-through-old"><em>Walking Through the Development Process</em></a> for further information on using
Mercurial queues to produce/manage patches.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reviewing-patches">
<span id="section-review-patches-old"></span><h2>Reviewing patches<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-patches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All code that goes into Sage is peer-reviewed, to ensure that the
conventions discussed in this manual are followed, to make sure that
there are sufficient examples and doctests in the documentation, and
to try to make sure that the code does, mathematically, what it is
supposed to.</p>
<p>If someone (other than you) has posted a patch for a ticket on the trac
server, you can review it! Look at the patch (by clicking on the file name
in the list of attachments) to see if it makes sense.  Download it (from
the window displaying the patch, see the &#8220;Download&#8221; option at the bottom of
the page). Apply it (using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hg_sage.patch('filename')</span></tt>, for example) to
your copy of Sage, and build Sage with the new code by typing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage</span> <span class="pre">-b</span></tt>.
See the walkthrough section <a class="reference internal" href="walk_through_old.html#section-review-patch-walkthrough"><em>Reviewing a patch</em></a> for
more details on downloading and applying patches.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself questions such as the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Does the new source code make sense?</li>
<li>When you run it in Sage, does it fix the problem reported on the
ticket?</li>
<li>Does it introduce any new problems?</li>
<li>Is it documented sufficiently, including both explanation and
doctests? This is <strong>very</strong> important: all code in Sage must have
doctests, so even if the patch is for code which did not have a
doctest before, the new version must include one. In particular,
all new code must be <strong>100% doctested</strong>. Use the command
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage</span> <span class="pre">-coverage</span> <span class="pre">&lt;files&gt;</span></tt> to see the coverage percentage of
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;files&gt;</span></tt>.</li>
<li>In particular, is there a doctest illustrating that the bug has been
fixed? If a function used to give the wrong answer and this patch fixes
that, then it should include a doctest illustrating its new success.
That doctest should be marked with the ticket number as an in-line
comment.</li>
<li>Is the ticket number noted in the comment line near the top of the patch?
Is the patch author noted in all the files which were edited?</li>
<li>If the patch claims to speed up some computation, does the ticket
contain code examples to illustrate the claim? The ticket should
explain the speed efficiency before applying the patch. It should
also explain the speed efficiency gained after applying the patch.
In both the &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; explanation, there should be
code samples to illustrate the claims. It is not sufficient to
just mention that the patch results in a speed-up of up to x
percent or y factor.</li>
<li>Does the reference manual build without errors? You can test the
reference manual using the command <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage</span> <span class="pre">-docbuild</span> <span class="pre">reference</span> <span class="pre">html</span></tt>
to build the HTML version. The PDF version of the reference manual
must also build without errors. Use the command
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage</span> <span class="pre">-docbuild</span> <span class="pre">reference</span> <span class="pre">pdf</span></tt> to test it out. The latter command
requires that you have LaTeX installed on your system.</li>
<li>Do all doctests pass without errors? This too is <strong>very</strong> important.  It
is extremely difficult to predict which components of Sage will be
affected by a given patch (especially if you don&#8217;t have working knowledge
of the <strong>entire</strong> Sage library), so you should run tests on the whole
library&#8211;including those flagged as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#long</span></tt>&#8211;before giving a positive
review.  (For that matter, the patch writer should run these tests before
uploading the patch.)  You can test the Sage library with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span>
<span class="pre">testlong</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">ptestlong</span></tt> (edit the number of threads in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$SAGE_ROOT/Makefile</span></tt> before using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ptestlong</span></tt>). See
<a class="reference internal" href="doctesting.html#chapter-doctesting"><em>Doctesting the Sage Library</em></a> for more information.</li>
<li>Do the code and documentation follow conventions documented in the
following sections?<ul>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="conventions.html#chapter-conventions"><em>Conventions for Coding in Sage</em></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="coding_in_python.html#chapter-python"><em>Coding in Python for Sage</em></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="coding_in_cython.html#chapter-cython"><em>Coding in Cython</em></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answers to these and other such reasonable questions are yes, then
you might want to give the patch a positive review. On the main ticket
page, write a comment in the box explaining your review. If you don&#8217;t feel
experienced enough for this, make a comment explaining what you checked,
and end by asking if someone more experienced will take a look.  If you
think there are issues with the patch, explain them in the comment box and
change the status to &#8220;needs work&#8221;. Browse the tickets on the trac server to
see how things are done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="closing-tickets">
<h2>Closing tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#closing-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Closing tickets is not possible unless you have &#8220;TICKET_ADMIN&#8221; rights in
Trac. This is because only the current Sage release manager should ever
close tickets. If you feel strongly that a ticket should be closed or
deleted, then change the status of the ticket to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">needs</span> <span class="pre">review</span></tt> and
change the milestone to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-duplictate/invalid/wontfix</span></tt>.
You should also comment on the ticket, explaining why it
should be closed. A related issue is re-opening tickets. You should
refrain from re-opening a ticket that is already closed. Instead
ask the release manager what to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reasons-to-invalidate-tickets">
<h2>Reasons to invalidate tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#reasons-to-invalidate-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>One Issue Per Ticket</strong>: A ticket must cover only one issue
and should not be a laundry list of unrelated issues. If a ticket
covers more than one issue, we cannot close it and while some of
the patches have been applied to a given release, the ticket would
remain in limbo.</p>
<p><strong>No Patch Bombs</strong>: Code that goes into Sage is peer-reviewed. If
you show up with an 80,000 lines of code bundle that completely
rips out a subsystem and replaces it with something else, you can
imagine that the review process will be a little tedious. These
huge patch bombs are problematic for several reasons and we prefer
small, gradual changes that are easy to review and apply. This is
not always possible (e.g. coercion rewrite), but it is still highly
recommended that you avoid this style of development unless there
is no way around it.</p>
<p><strong>Sage Specific</strong>: Sage&#8217;s philosophy is that we ship everything
(or close to it) in one source tarball to make debugging possible.
You can imagine the combinatorial explosion we would have to deal
with if you replaced only ten components of Sage with external
packages. Once you start replacing some of the more essential
components of Sage that are commonly packaged (e.g. Pari, GAP,
lisp, gmp), it is no longer a problem that belongs in our tracker.
If your distribution&#8217;s Pari package is buggy for example, file a
bug report with them. We are usually willing and able to solve
the problem, but there are no guarantees that we will help you
out. Looking at the open number of tickets that are Sage specific,
you hopefully will understand why.</p>
<p><strong>No Support Discussions</strong>: The trac installation is not meant to
be a system to track down problems when using Sage. Tickets should
be clearly a bug and not &#8220;I tried to do X and I couldn&#8217;t get it to
work. How do I do this?&#8221; That is usually not a bug in Sage and it
is likely that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sage-support</span></tt> can answer that question for you. If
it turns out that you did hit a bug, somebody will open a concise
and to-the-point ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Must Be Achievable</strong>: Tickets must be achievable. Many
times, tickets that fall into this category usually ran afoul to
some of the other rules listed above. An example would be to
&#8220;Make Sage the best CAS in the world&#8221;. There is no metric to
measure this properly and it is highly subjective.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="milestones-vs-releases">
<h2>Milestones vs. releases<a class="headerlink" href="#milestones-vs-releases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Milestones are usually goals to be met while working toward a
release. In Sage&#8217;s trac, we use milestones instead of releases, but
unless somebody volunteers to clean up all the old milestones, we
will stick with the current model. It does not make a whole lot of
difference if we use milestone instead of release.</p>
<p>Finely grained releases are good. Release early and often is the way
to go, especially as more and more patches are coming in.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to make a big release and schedule at least one
more bug fix release after that to sort out the inevitable
&#8220;doctest X is broken on distribution Y and compiler Z&#8221; problem.
Given the number of compilers and operating systems out there, one
has to be realistic to expect problems. A compile farm would
certainly help to catch issues early.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assigning-tickets">
<h2>Assigning tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#assigning-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each ticket must have a milestone assigned. If you are unsure,
assign it to the current milestone.</li>
<li>If a ticket has a patch or spkg that is ready to be reviewed,
assign it against the current milestone.</li>
<li>Defect vs. enhancement vs. task: this can be tricky, but a defect
should be something that leads to an exception or a mathematically
wrong result.</li>
<li>If you are unsure to whom to assign the ticket, assign it to
&#8220;somebody&#8221; or &#8220;tba&#8221;, which stands for &#8220;to be assigned&#8221;.</li>
<li>Certain categories have default people who get assigned all
issues. For example, Jane Smith might be the default person who gets
assigned all tickets relating to calculus. This means that Jane
looks after tickets in that category, but not necessarily the person
who is to fix all open tickets relating to calculus.</li>
<li>If you have been assigned a ticket, you should either accept it
or assign it back to &#8220;somebody&#8221; or &#8220;tba&#8221;. Many people do not accept
pending tickets at the moment. You have accepted a ticket if your
name has a star next to it.</li>
