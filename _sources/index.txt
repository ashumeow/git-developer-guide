======================================
Welcome to the Sage Developer's Guide!
======================================

Everybody who uses Sage is encouraged to contribute something back to
Sage at some point. Implement a new function, add examples to the
documentation, find bugs and typos, fix a bug, create a new class,
create a fast new C library, etc. This document describes how to write
programs using Sage, how to modify and extend the core Sage libraries,
and how to modify Sage's documentation. We also discuss how to share
your new and modified code with other Sage users around the globe.
